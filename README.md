### Practice your keyboard skills

---

This is a simple keyboard game where you will be shown a random alphabet on the screen, and your task is to press the exact same letter on your keyboard. The game will track the time it takes for you to press the key and provide feedback on your performance.

## How to Play

- Once the game starts, you will see a random alphabet displayed on the screen.

- Pay attention to the displayed alphabet and quickly press the corresponding key on your keyboard.

- The game will track the time it takes for you to press the key and provide feedback on your performance.

- If you press the correct key, the time interval will be displayed in green. If you press the wrong key, the time interval will be displayed in red.

- The game will continue with new random alphabets as you progress. Try to achieve the lowest possible time intervals for each key press.

- The game will end after a certain number of attempts. Your correct count, wrong count, and average time will be displayed.
